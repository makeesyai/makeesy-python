### Exercise 1
Ask the user for a number. 
Depending on whether the number is even or odd, 
print out an appropriate message to the user.

```bash
Input: 32
Output: Even Number.

Input: 31
Output: Odd Number.
```

### Exercise 2
Write a program that takes a list of numbers 
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the 
given list.

```bash
Input: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
Output: [5, 25]

Input: [1, 4, 12, 0]
Output: [1, 0]
```

### Exercise 3
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and another number.
The function decides whether or not the given number 
is inside the list and returns (then prints) an appropriate boolean.

```
Input: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], 5
Output: True

Input: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], 9
Output: False
```
