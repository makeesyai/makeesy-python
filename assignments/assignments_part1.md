### Exercise 1
Write a program that takes a collection of numbers (use the proper datatype)
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the 
given list.

```bash
Input: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
Output: [5, 25]

Input: [1, 4, 12, 0]
Output: [1, 0]
```

### Exercise 2
Write a program that takes a list of numbers (use the proper datatype) and 
another number. Then decides whether or not the given number is inside the list 
and prints (then prints) an appropriate boolean.

```
Input: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], 5
Output: True

Input: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], 9
Output: False
```

### Exercise 3
Write a Python program which takes first 
and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.

```
INPUT: first = 'Raj Nath', last: 'Patel'
OUTPUT: Patel Raj Nath
```
### Exercise 4
Write a Python program to extract single key-value pair of a dictionary in variables.
```
INPUT: collection = {1: 'Hello', 2: 'World'}
OUTPUT: 1:'Hello', or 2:'World' (randomly)
```
### Exercise 5
Write a Python program to test if a variable is a list or tuple or set or a dict.

```
INPUT: x = {'a', 2, 4}
OUTPUT: set

INPUT: x = ['a', 2, 4]
OUTPUT: list
```
