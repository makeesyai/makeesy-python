# Function: The idea of function is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function,
# so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.


# Pass by Reference or pass by value?
# One important thing to note is, in Python every variable name is a reference.
# When we pass a variable to a function, a new reference to the object is created.
