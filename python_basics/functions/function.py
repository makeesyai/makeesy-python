# Function: The idea of function is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function,
# so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.

# Illustrate the code repetition with print two lists (integer, strings),
# then implement the same using function
# Optional Attributes: arguments, doc string, return statement

# Function with Doc String (add doc string and print)

# Scope of variables (define the same variable in global and function scope)

# Function with return value (no arguments)
