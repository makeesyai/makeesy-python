# Tuple: is just like list with the exception that tuples cannot be changed once declared.
# Tuples are usually faster than lists.

# Create empty, (not of much use, as can not be modified)
# var_tuple = ()
# var_tuple = tuple()

# Create with values,

# get (by indexing)

# replace(completely)
# var_tuple[1] = "python"  # ERROR
