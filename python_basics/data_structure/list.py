# Python have 4 types of built in Data Structures namely-
# Ordered (indexing is allowed): List, Tuple:immutable
# Unordered (indexing is not allowed): Dictionary, and Set

# LIST: is a mutable data structure i.e items can be added to list later after the list creation.
# it need not be always homogeneous i.e. a single list can contain strings, integers, as well as objects.

# Create empty
var_list = list()
var_list = []

# Create with values

# Get (indexing),

# Replace (indexing)

# Append

# Remove
