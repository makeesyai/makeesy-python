# Create A, and B, then inherit both in extended class
# 1. Test init without supper()
# 2. Add super in first class in the inheritance and print the consumption of the arguments
# 3. Change the order of the classes in inheritance order,
# for example if it was (A,B) change it to (B, A), it'll fail
# 4. Change the order of arguments and fix with keyword arguments
# 5. Add C as parent class to A, and now pass 3 arguments, show that MRO uses
